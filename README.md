# Twitter Tools
This is a personal project to learn how to use technologies like Vue or Flask.

Twitter management tools to block bots and hoaxes accounts easily and perform batch actions.

## Update

I will not maintain this repository anymore because I deleted my Twitter account. It is no longer an interesting social network for me, it only promotes hatred, confrontation and lies. 
If you want to keep the project feel free to fork it out and if you have any doubt, don't hesitate to ask me.

There are some functions that are still unfinished and some that I have not been able to implement, but for the most part they should fulfill their objective.
